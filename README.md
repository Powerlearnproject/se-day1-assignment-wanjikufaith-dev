Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design , develop,test, deploy and maintain software systems creating reliable scalable and efficient  software solutions. 
Software engineering is important in the technology industry since it ; 
Enhances software quality and reliability by following standardised testing and debugging procedures maintaining excellent performance.
Efficient and cost-effective by using structured methodologies,avoids unnecessary resource consumption by optimising code and system design 
Security and data , software engineering ensures compliance with industry regulations e.g HIPAA and GDPR 
Drives innovation, enables advancements in Ai , cloud computing ,block chain and Iot 
Software Engineering supports business growth and digital transformation enabling companies stay competitive by adopting latest software solutions 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering 1968 -transition of the programming view from adhoc craft to a systematic engineering discipline 
Structured Programming and Methodologies 1970s - introduction of structured programming techniques like modular design and top down design improved code readability and maintenance
DevOps and Continous Delivery 2010s- continuous intergration / delivery pipelines became central rapid and reliable software releases 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
A software development life cycle is a structured process seed to design ,develop test and deploy software efficiently.
1. planning - defines project scope , objectives and feasibility aids in estimating time cost and needed resources
2. Requirement analysis - identify business technical needs of the software by gathering functional and nonfunctional requirements
3. Design - creating architectural blueprints and design focusing on database structures , system interfaces and security
4. Development - actual coding of the design specification and best practices using programming languages
5. Testing- ensure the software is bug free, secure and meets requirements
6. Deployment - launching  the software for users either in phases or  at once  . May also involve onsite installations and cloud based installations
7. Maintenance and support- fixing bugs , update features to ensure stability. include performance monitoring and security patches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 The waterfall methodologies is a linear ,sequential approach where each phase must be completed before  moving  to the next.
 The key characteristics follows a fixed sequence [ planning - design - development- testing - deployment -maintenance ] 
 Extensive documentation is required and change is difficult to accommodate once the project has started
 Best suited for projects with well defined requirements and minimal expected changes.
 Agile methodology however is an interactive and flexible approach where development happens in small cycles called sprints. 
 Agile key characteristics include ; focusing on collaboration , continuous feedback and flexibility 
 working software is delivered incrementally after each sprint 
 allows for change and improvements throughout development and is best suited for dynamic projects where requirements evolve over time  
 Example of an Agile methodology is a E- commerce  website development whereas construction and manufacturing software e.g  hospital management system is an example of a waterfall methodology. 
 Both waterfall and agile have their strengths and weaknesses. waterfall is great for structured projects with fixed requirements while Agile is ideal for dynamic , customer driven software development. 
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for designing coding and implementing software solutions based on project requirements . some responsibilities include ; writing clean efficient and maintainable code , collaborating with designers testers and product managers ,debugging and troubleshooting software issues , implementing new features and optimising existing ones 
A Quality Assurance engineer ensures that the software products meet quality standards by identifying bugs and improving performance before release. some responsibilities include ; designing and executing test cases , identifying documenting and tracking software bugs , performing different types of testing e.g unit integration, regression and performance
Product manager defines the software vision , prioritises  features and  ensures the final product meets business and user needs . key responsibilities include gathering and analysing customer requirements , defining the product roadmap and prioritising features , communication between developers , designers and stakeholder. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
